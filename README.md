## Paper Report

You can find the submitted paper in [This Link](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2740631/v1).

This repository includes the implementation of dynamic quantum clustering as a result of a master's thesis. The code has been made available as a reference if anyone would like to reproduce the results of the thesis.

The whole code, until 28.6.2021, is the result of a final Master's Thesis of the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence supervised by Prof. Loo Chu Koing. 

## Setting up

Recommend using [miniconda](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for

```shell
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
$ conda activate dqc
```
