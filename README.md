This repository includes the implementation of dynamic quantum clustering as result of a master's thesis. The code has been made available as a reference if anyone would like to reproduce the results of the thesis.

The whole code, until 28.6.2021, is the result of a final Master's Thesis of the Master's Degree in Artificial Intelligence supervised by Prof. Loo Chu Koing. 

## Setting up
